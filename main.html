		<h1>U.S. Inflation Hit 30-Year High in October as Consumer Prices Jump 6.2%</h1>
		<h2>Core index was up 4.6% as pandemic-related supply shortages and strong consumer demand continue as part of America's economic recovery.</h2>
		<p><strong>By Gwynn Guilford</strong></p>

		<p>U.S. inflation hit a three-decade high in October, delivering widespread and sizable price increases to households for everything from groceries to cars due to persistent supply shortages and strong consumer demand.</p>

		<p>The Labor Department said the consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for goods and services—increased in October by 6.2% from a year ago. That was the fastest 12-month pace since 1990 and the fifth straight month of inflation above 5%.</p>

		<p>The core price index, which excludes the often-volatile categories of food and energy, climbed 4.6% in October from a year earlier, higher than September’s 4% rise and the largest increase since 1991.</p>

		<p>On a monthly basis, the CPI increased a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in October from the prior month, a sharp acceleration from September’s 0.4% rise and the same as June’s 0.9% pace.</p>

		<p>Price increases were broad-based, with higher costs for new and used autos, gasoline and other energy costs, furniture, rent and medical care, the Labor Department said. Food prices for both groceries and dining out rose by the most in decades. Prices fell for airline fares and alcohol.

		<p>Persistently higher inflation—triggered by a faster-than-anticipated but uneven economic recovery, trillions of dollars in pandemic-related government stimulus and other factors—is hitting consumers’ wallets. At the same time, a rebounding economy and healthy household balance sheets are both stoking demand and cushioning price increases.</p>

		<p>The inflation surge is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-inflation-cpi-rates-11636552015?mod=article_inline"target="_blank">complicating the Federal Reserve’s strategy </a>for unwinding easy-money policies the central bank imposed early in the pandemic.

		<p>Prices climbed the fastest in the South, a part of the country that reopened earlier in the pandemic but was hit relatively harder by the Delta variant of Covid-19. Prices were also up more in the Midwest than in the Northeast and West...
