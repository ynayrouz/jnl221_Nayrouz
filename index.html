		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" target="_blank">Data breach hacks</a>, Information Is Beautiful</li>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/" target="_blank">Hip hop vocabulary</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Drones dropped in Pakistan</a>, Pitch Interactive</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3> The World's Biggest Data Breaches & Hacks </h3>
		<p> 
			The data in this project (which is so cool) is from a collection of news stories about these breaches. If you look at the raw dataset, they've compilated multiple news stories from various sources such as the New York Times, Forbes, The Guardian, Tech Radar, BBC, PC Mag, Tech Crunch and others. From these stories, the journalists extracted the data they needed to create this visualization, such as the year, the number of people affected, and the company.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dataviz uses the size of circles to represent how many individuals were impacted by each breach, so the bigger the circle, the more people were affected by the breach. This also effectively communicates a main idea in this story that since 2004, breaches have been affecting more individuals per breach.

			<p>Additionally, it took me a while to figure out what the colors represent because their legend wasn't noticable to me. They use a yellow circle to represent what they consider an interesting story. This is a great use of color because the contrast is evident, and it stands out more. Although, it made wonder how they determined whether a story was interesting or not, but I realized that the "interesting" stories really semmed to be those that got the most attention. </p>

			<p>I also think they used the visual element of space to effectively convey its key message that the number of breaches is increasing. By having the empty space between the circles clearly shrink over time, this visualization makes it evident to a reader that more and more breaches are occuring.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, they use elements of interactivity. For instance, a reader can hover over a circle to learn more information about a particular breach. Also, if you click on a circle, it will take you to a news story about that breach, for more in-depth information.
		</p>
		<p>
			This data story is visceral because it creates a feeling of fear or worry. More data breaches are occuring, and each one is affecting more individuals. The cluster of circles at the top is memorable because it reflects this urgency or concern that this is a serious current issue.
		</p>



		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here: -->

		<iframe title="U.S. Troops in Afghanistan" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-LV88E" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/LV88E/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
